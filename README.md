# Car_Market_Exploratory_data_analysis
Project Description-
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a used car dataset. The goal is to understand the various factors that influence the price of a used car. The analysis includes:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, and manipulating categorical and numerical data.

- Data Understanding: Checking data types, identifying null values, and removing unnecessary columns like S.No. and New_Price.

- Feature Engineering: Creating a new Brand column from the car's Name and cleaning the Engine and Power columns to remove units.

- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between different variables using statistical and visual methods. The analysis revealed a strong correlation between Engine and Power.

Dataset-

The project uses the used_cars_data.csv dataset. This dataset contains information on a variety of used cars, including:

- Name, Location, Year

- Kilometers Driven

- Fuel Type, Transmission, Owner Type

- Mileage, Engine, Power, and Seats.

- Price

Tools and Libraries Used-

- Python: The primary programming language.

- Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment used for the analysis.

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

- NumPy: For numerical operations.

- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
